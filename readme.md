# Linear Regression in SPSS
The Multiple Regression Analysis can be used to predict the price value of real estate, provided that 
comprehensive dataset and all relative variables are available. If all the requirements are fulfilled, 
then any real estate company can successfully evaluate property value and can predict the future value as well. 
Accurate and well-built model using different methods can replace the Real Estate Evaluators for sure. 
For this purpose, the Multiple Regression Model can use any of the two methods, i.e. the Enter Method or the Stepwise Method.
Through using any of these two methods, the price can be estimated. The price estimation can help the real estate builders in 
evaluating their profit margins in the buying and selling of their respective real estate property assets.
